      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <section>
        <p>To maintain a civil community, the server has some common-sense rules listed as a formality.</p>
        <p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Be respectful</strong>; this means no discrimination,
          insults/slurs, or unjustified hostility. In a mutually-consensual or
          joking manner, this can be reasonably permitted.</li>
          <li><strong>No spamming</strong>; this includes posting the same message
          repeatedly, excessive message fragmentation, and regularly sidetracking
          existing conversations.</li>
          <li>Be cautious when discussing <strong>sensitive topics</strong> like
          politics, religion, tragedies, and mental health. If necessary, avoid
          them altogether.</li>
          <li><strong>Alternative accounts</strong> are permitted if there is
          sufficient justification for them. Ask a mod if you would like to invite
          one.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>These rules will be enforced by the moderators. If a member's violation of them bothers you or is destructive to the server, please contact a moderator or report them via the bot.</p>
        <p>Members that are found to be breaking the rules (either by a moderator or through member reports) will be audited and the moderators will reach a consensus on what action—if any—should be taken.</p>
